# DoorControl

This project uses and [Arduino MKR1000](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoMKR1000), [Adafruit Metro Mini](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2590), [Adafruit PowerBoost 1000C](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2465?gclid=CL3RyvPU7csCFZCIaQodzmoI8A), and a [Lockitron](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2579) to unlock a door via RFID.
You can also use the Windows 10 app to control it via your phone.


## Installation

I created a Hackster.io tutorial for this https://www.hackster.io/keebie81/rfid-door-unlock-fa66ea
